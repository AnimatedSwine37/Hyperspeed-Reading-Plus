# Hyperspeed-Reading-Plus
Mod that makes it so if you've read Hyperspeed Reading when reading a book with only one chapter left you'll be able to read another chapter of another book afterwards. 

To compile the bf files you will need to replace the library folder in your copy of AtlusScriptCompiler with [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/476948840063434752/774077518826700800/P4GLibrary.7z) made by [Sierrai17](https://gamebanana.com/members/1749229). This turns a lot of the nameless functions into named ones and is generally very useful.

The original files are from: *data00004/event_data/script/e860_034a.bf
                             *data00004/field/pack/fd007_003.arc/f007.bf
